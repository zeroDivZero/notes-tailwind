# OVERVIEW

Open-source CSS framework. Unlike **Bootstrap**, doesn't provide predefined classes for elements like buttons or tables. Instead, it creates "utility" CSS classes to style element by mixing and matching.

Works by scanning HTML files, JavaScript components, and templates for class names, generating corresponding styles and writing them to static CSS file.
